Description: Provides advanced Bayesian methods to estimate
	     abundance and run-timing from temporally-stratified
	     Petersen mark-recapture experiments. Methods include
	     hierarchical modelling of the capture probabilities
  	     and spline smoothing of the daily run size. Theory
  	     described in Bonner and Schwarz (2011)
